- Implement bulk actions for managing multiple applications at once
- Consider adding custom fields configuration for the application form
- Add granular privacy controls for applicants to choose which information they want to share
- Create additional contact methods that don't expose personal information directly

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
1. Industry Access Method:
   - Industry data can be accessed in two formats: as an object or as an array
   - Object format: Use $industry->slug and $industry->name
   - Array format: Use $industry['slug'] and $industry['name']
   - All code now checks for both formats to ensure consistent access
   - Industries are primarily stored as taxonomy terms (bpp_industry)
   - Fallback exists to read industry from post meta (bpp_industry) if taxonomy relation is missing
   - Default industry list is provided if terms can't be retrieved:
     - Nature-based work
     - Environmental policy
     - Climate science
     - Green construction & infrastructure

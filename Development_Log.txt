# Black Potential Pipeline Plugin - Development Log

## Day 1: Initial Setup

### Tasks Completed:
- Created Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- Set up basic plugin structure
- Defined plugin metadata
- Created custom post type for applicant profiles
- Defined taxonomy for industry categories
- Created plugin core classes:
  - Main plugin class (BPP)
  - Loader class for hooks and filters
  - Internationalization class
  - Post Types class
  - Shortcodes class
  - Admin class
  - Public class
- Created admin dashboard template
- Created submission form template
- Created directory template
- Added CSS for admin and public interfaces
- Created documentation in README.md

### Next Steps:

- Create remaining public templates (category directory, featured, statistics)
- Add JavaScript functionality for admin and public interfaces
- Implement form submission processing
- Implement approval/rejection workflow
- Add email notifications
- Test all functionality
- Optimize for performance

## Technical Decisions:

1. **Plugin Structure**:
   - Using object-oriented approach for better organization
   - Separating admin and public-facing functionality
   - Following WordPress coding standards

2. **Data Storage**:
   - Custom post type "bpp_applicant" for applicant profiles
   - Custom taxonomy "bpp_industry" for the four industry categories
   - Custom meta fields for additional applicant information
   - Using WordPress media library for file uploads with proper security

3. **Implementation Approach**:
   - Phase 1: Core functionality (submission, admin review) - COMPLETED
   - Phase 2: Directory display and shortcodes - PARTIALLY COMPLETED
   - Phase 3: Enhanced features (filtering, search, etc.) - TO DO
   - Phase 4: Testing and optimization - TO DO

## Known Issues and Limitations:
- Need to implement proper security for file uploads
- Need to add AJAX processing for form submissions
- Need to implement email notifications
- Need to add proper validation for form inputs
- Need to add admin JavaScript for approval/rejection workflow

## Notes for Future Development:
- Consider adding user accounts for applicants to manage their profiles
- Add option for employers to create accounts and contact applicants
- Add analytics dashboard for tracking views and interactions
- Consider adding integration with job board plugins
- Add option for automatic approval workflow based on criteria
